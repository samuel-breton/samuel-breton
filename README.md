# 👋 Hi, I'm Samuel Breton

![Cloud architect](https://img.shields.io/badge/Cloud%20architect-AWS%20%7C%20Azure%20%7C%20GCP-blue?style=flat-square&logo=icloud&logoColor=white)
![Automation enthusiast](https://img.shields.io/badge/Automation%20enthusiast-Terraform%20%7C%20Ansible-purple?style=flat-square&logo=terraform&logoColor=white)

I design and build secure, scalable cloud architectures across AWS, Azure, and GCP.<br />
My work sits at the intersection of Infrastructure as Code, automation, and security engineering.

I believe infrastructure should be:

- Declarative
- Reproducible
- Versioned
- Observable
- Secure by default
